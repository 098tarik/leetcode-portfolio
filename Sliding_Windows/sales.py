"""
Given an array, sales, find the most sales in any 7-day period.


Example 1: sales = [0, 3, 7, 12, 10, 5, 0, 1, 0, 15, 12, 11, 1]
Output: 44
The 7-day period with the most sales is [5, 0, 1, 0, 15, 12, 11].

Example 2: sales = [0, 3, 7, 12]
Output: 0
There is no 7-day period.

Example 3: sales = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Output: 28
The only 7-day period is the entire array.
Constraints:

The length of sales is at most 10^6
Each element in sales is a non-negative integer less than 10^3
